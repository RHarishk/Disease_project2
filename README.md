# Dependency Analysis and Prediction Using Healthcare Datasets

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and tools to analyze and train machine learning models on healthcare datasets. The objective is to find dependency relationships between variables and predict outcomes for independent variables.

## Datasets

The following datasets are included for analysis:

1. **Indian Liver Patient Dataset**: Contains data related to liver health indicators.
2. **Kidney Disease Dataset**: Provides information about various indicators of kidney health.
3. **Parkinson's Dataset**: Includes features relevant to diagnosing Parkinson's disease.

### Dataset Details

- **Indian Liver Patient Dataset**
  - Objective: Analyze liver health indicators to predict the likelihood of liver disease.

- **Kidney Disease Dataset**
  - Objective: Determine dependencies among variables to predict kidney disease status.

- **Parkinson's Dataset**
  - Objective: Identify patterns in data to classify the presence of Parkinson's disease.

## Features of This Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize and standardize data
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate statistical summaries
   - Identify important predictors

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)
   - Perform cross-validation
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

4. **Prediction**:
   - Predict outcomes for new independent variables
   - Provide insights into dependency relationships

5. **Make Predictions**:
   Use trained models to make predictions on new data.
